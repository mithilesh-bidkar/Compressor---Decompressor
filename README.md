The Data Compression ans Decompression project aims to reduce the number of bits required to represent data using compression techniques. The project focuses on achieving compression without any loss of data, employing only lossless conversion methods. By implementing this project, we can realize several benefits such as saving storage space, speeding up file transfers, and reducing storage hardware and network bandwidth costs. The key objective is to ensure that the compressed files can be restored to their original form accurately.

# Features
The project includes the following features:

Lossless Compression: The compression techniques utilized in the project ensure that no data is lost during the compression process. The original data can be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed files.

Reduced Storage Space: By compressing data, the project significantly reduces the amount of storage space required to store files or data.

Improved File Transfer Speed: Compressed files can be transferred more quickly over networks or through file-sharing platforms due to their reduced size.

Cost Reduction: The project's compression techniques help minimize storage hardware and network bandwidth costs, as less space is needed to store and transmit data.

Restoration of Compressed Files: The project ensures that compressed files can be accurately restored to their original form without any loss of data.
